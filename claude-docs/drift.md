# Drift Notes — Corrections & Discrepancies

Log every correction that alters a row later rows built on. Fix cumulatives from that row forward.

## Intentionally excluded (struck-through / void) entries
- **IMG_4925 / 18/04/2019 / P28A OH-PIF / EFLA → EFLA / 10:00–12:03 / 2:03:** struck through —
  excluded. Paper running total skips it (562:32 → 563:55).
- **IMG_4925 / 12/04/2019 / P28A OH-PDP / EFPR → EFHF:** void first-row entry with no time, not in
  the page total — excluded (the EFHF→EFPR outbound is the last row of IMG_4924).

- **IMG_4921 / 15/10/2018 / C172 OH-CWB / EFHF → EFHF / 12:15–13:12 / 0:57:** this line is
  **struck through in the paper book** — a wrong entry. It is deliberately **NOT** in
  `logbook_2.csv`. Do not "recover" it. The paper's own running total skips it (538:19 → 539:04).

## Confirmed corrections
- **IMG_4921 / 04/10/2018 / P28A OH-PDP / EFHF → EFHF / 1:20 / 4 landings — instructor time.**
  This is an *instructing* flight: the paper logs 1:20 under **both** Päällikkö (PIC) and Opettaja
  (instructor). Originally appended with PIC only; corrected on 2026-07-31 to also set
  `Instructor_Time = 1:20`, bumping `Cumulative_Instructor` 7:57 → **9:17** on that row and all rows
  after. PIC/Total/Student/SEP/Landings unchanged. Convention confirmed by the next page's carry
  (instructor 9:17). This is the pilot's first *instructing* flight in Book 2.

- **IMG_4905 / 28/06/2017 / P28A OH-PDP / EFHF → EFHF:** correct total is **00:37**, not 00:36.
  Cumulative Total and PIC corrected +00:01 from that row onward.
- **IMG_4908 / 02/09/2017 / C172 OH-CTL / VEHMERSALMI → HIRVENSALMI:** correct total is **01:04**,
  not 01:08. Paper book is +00:04 too high from that point if left uncorrected.
- **IMG_4908 / 08/10/2017 flights:** both are **student time** with PIC "Stude".

## Flagged paper anomalies (not corrections — our value kept)
- **IMG_4929 / 08/06/2019 / C172 OH-CTL / Sipoo → Tuusulanjärvi:** off-block 13:43 / on-block 14:12
  = 29 min, but the paper's logged flight time is **0:27** (and the right-page cumulative advances by
  0:27: 590:48 → 591:15). Kept Total 0:27; recorded Off/On as written. Likely on-block is 14:10, not
  14:12. Cumulatives unaffected.
- **IMG_4929 (pages 62/63) — paper PIC over-count.** Every row this page is PIC, so true Δ_PIC =
  Δ_total = **5:44**. The paper's PIC column advances **5:52** (477:21 → 483:13), an 8-min slip on the
  paper side. Our Cumulative_PIC (→ 487:12) is the correct figure. Δtotal/Δinstr/Δland all reconciled
  exactly, so this is isolated to the paper's PIC arithmetic. Consistent with the standing PIC-drift note.

- **IMG_4931 (pages 66/67) — paper running-total under-count of 30 min.** The pilot's own margin
  notes read **"+30" on row 4** (28/06/2019 OH-PIF EFHA→EFLA, 1:00) and "−2" on row 3. The paper's
  Kokonaisaika column advances only 6:33 across the page while PIC+student (and the true row totals
  from off/on block) sum to **7:03** — the total column was under-added by 30 min from row 4 on. Our
  cumulatives use the real row totals (row 4 = 1:00, off/on 11:23→12:23), so **our Cumulative_Total
  now runs ~26 min AHEAD of the paper's printed total** (the +30 slip minus the pre-existing paper
  +4). Confirmed: Δpic 4:41, Δstudent 2:22, Δinstrument 2:22, Δland 15 all reconcile exactly.
- **Place-name reads confirmed by user (2026-07-31):** the lake logged as `EFKU/Jälä` is **Iso-Jälä**
  (18/06/2019 OH-CDK departure); `Leikonvesi` (not "Leikanvesi") is the correct spelling on all
  IMG_4930/4931 rows; `EFHA` (IMG_4931 rows 3/4 OH-PIF) is correct.
- **IMG_4931 / 04/07/2019 / C172 OH-GKT / Kahvisaari → Kuohijärvi:** off 12:03 / on 12:37 = 34 min,
  logged flight time **0:36**. Kept 0:36 (the logged/cumulative value); recorded off/on as written.
- **IMG_4930 / 19/06/2019 / C185 OH-CDK / Salonsaari local (student, 12 landings):** off 15:25Z /
  on 16:24Z = 59 min, logged flight time **0:54**. Kept 0:54. **Zulu** row (Z suffix). Instructor =
  **Jansson** (floatplane training, not the IR course). Rows 4/5/6 of IMG_4930 all tagged Zulu.

- **IMG_4933 (pages 70/71) — paper PIC column under-count of 53 min, pilot self-corrected.** The
  paper's written PIC bottom total is 499:48, but the true page Δpic (rows 1+2+8 = 0:33+0:53+0:31 =
  1:57 on the carried 498:44) is **500:41** — written by hand under the table as "500 41". Our
  Cumulative_PIC uses the correct 500:41-basis. All other page Δ (total 9:29, student 7:32,
  instrument 7:32, land 11) reconcile. Combined with the IMG_4931 +30 total slip, the paper's
  printed PIC column now runs well behind ours; cross-check on per-page Δ only.
- **IMG_4933 / 01/08/2019 / P28A OH-PDP / EFHF → EFLA:** the off/on block was struck/rewritten in the
  book ("1035/1024" crossed out). User confirmed (2026-07-31) the correct block is **10:10–11:03**
  (= 0:53, matches the logged total). Recorded.

## IMG_4934/4935/4936 batch (pages 72–77, 10/08–27/09/2019) — appended 2026-07-31
- **New instructing flights (PIC + Instructor).** Paper logged time in the Opettaja column for:
  **13/08/2019 C185 OH-CDK Salonsaari local** (1:16, 10 landings — first floatplane *instructing*)
  and **28/08/2019 C172 OH-CTL Vuosaari→Tuusulanjärvi** (0:28, 3 landings). Both set
  `Instructor_Time = PIC_Time = Total`. Page Δinstructor 1:44 reconciled exactly.
- **27.08 → 27.09 date fix (IMG_4936 row 6).** Paper wrote "27.08" for the OH-PIF EFLA→EFJY flight,
  but Aviatron shows it as **27.09.2019** (09:28–11:13 UTC, matches paper 0928–1113) and chronology
  (between 22.09 and the other 27.09 rows) agrees. Recorded as **27/09/2019**.
- **IMG_4936 pilot correction ("IR-aika / oppilasaika / kokonaisaika tarkistettu ja korjattu
  27.9.2019").** The page's bottom **Total** = 650:33, but the sum of the 8 row totals on the carried
  640:17 is **650:02** — i.e. the pilot added a ~31-min lump catch-up to the Total column (fixing the
  earlier IMG_4931 −30 undercount). Instrument (Mittari 40:08) and Student (136:36) each read +1 min
  over our row sums (40:07 / 136:35) — small hand corrections. **Our row-based figures are
  authoritative** (Total 650:28, computed from off/on block). Effect: paper's printed Total now runs
  **~5 min AHEAD** of ours (was ~26 behind); PIC still lags. Per-page Δpic 1:31 and Δland 11
  reconciled exactly; Δtotal/Δstudent/Δinstr were intentionally not cross-checked on this page
  because the pilot's lump correction makes the column deltas non-comparable.
- **Timezone / `Z` suffix.** Every OH-PIF row and the 10/08 OH-GKT row match Aviatron's UTC block
  times **to the minute**, proving the paper wrote them in UTC (no `Z` marked in the book). Per user
  decision (2026-07-31) these were recorded **with `Z`**; OH-PDP/OH-CTL/OH-CDK left plain/local (the
  17/09 OH-PDP EFHF→EFLA row is explicitly marked "LT" in the book).
- **Z backfill of earlier plain-but-UTC OH-PIF rows (done 2026-07-31).** Added `Z` to 12 rows that
  had been appended without it: 18/04/2019 (×3), 14/06, 28/06 (×2), 23/07, 01/08 (×2), 02/08 (×3).
  Eleven match Aviatron's UTC block times to the minute. **The 18/04/2019 05:44–06:35 EFLA→EFLA row
  is the one exception — inferred UTC, not Aviatron-confirmed** (Aviatron omits it, likely a solo/
  warm-up; but its two same-day sibling lessons are UTC and a 05:44 *local* start = 02:44 UTC is
  implausibly pre-dawn). If the pilot recalls that flight was logged local, drop its `Z`. Only the
  Off_Block/On_Block strings changed; all cumulatives are byte-identical (Z is stripped by
  `logbook_tools.py` when computing). Remaining plain OH-PIF rows: none. Plain (local) rows are now
  only the club/seaplane types (OH-PDP/OH-CTL/OH-CDK/OH-STL where applicable).
- **Two near-identical OH-PDP ferries (not a duplicate).** 17/09 EFHF→EFLA (IMG_4935) and 19/09
  EFLA→EFHF (IMG_4936) are both logged as 0855/0859–0945/0946, 0:51, 1 landing. The paper counts
  each on its own page (both included). Times likely an estimate/copy; kept as written.
- **Instrument seed drift.** Our Cumulative_Instrument (44:10) runs **+4:02** ahead of the paper's
  Mittari column (40:08) — accumulated seed drift present since the IMG_4933 checkpoint (paper siirto
  23:05 vs our 27:08). All per-page instrument Δ match the paper's Mittari Δ (2:55 / 5:53 / 8:14).

## Standing discrepancy — paper landing count
The paper logbook's **cumulative landing count runs ahead of the true count.** At the historical
IMG_4910 checkpoint the paper showed 1051 but 1050 was correct (paper +1). Treat the paper
running landing total as suspect; cross-check landing sums on new pages.

## Historical checkpoint (superseded — see resume.md for current)
- After IMG_4910: last row 15/03/2018 C172 OH-CWB EFHF→EFHF total 00:26 PIC self;
  cumulatives Total 467:48, PIC 379:50, Student 87:58, Instrument 3:12, SEP_Sea 94:03,
  Landings 1051 paper / 1050 correct.
